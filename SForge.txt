🪜 MVP ROADMAP (4–6 weeks realistic):
✅ Week 0–1: Plan & scaffold
Choose first target: Next.js (modern, popular, solid docs)

Choose options:

Tailwind CSS

Zustand / Redux

ESLint + Prettier

Auth (skip at first, or add Supabase later)

Design folder template: pages/, components/, lib/, hooks/

🛠 Week 1–2: Build core engine
Node.js CLI or backend that:

Takes config

Generates folder + installs deps

API: User hits “Generate” → backend zips project & returns link

Store config for repeat (localStorage or Supabase)

🖼 Week 2–3: Frontend UI
Simple Next.js app:

Dropdowns & toggles to pick features

“Generate project” button

On submit → POST to backend → return zip link

Landing page explaining what it is

🧪 Week 3–4: Launch & feedback
Soft launch:

Twitter, IndieHackers, Discord groups

Watch what breaks, what people want

Collect emails for update list

💰 Monetization (start free, but design for it):
Save custom templates (paid)

Push to private GitHub repo (paid)

AI assistant: “Describe your app…” → config auto-filled (paid)

Monthly: $5–10 starter, $20+ team

⚙ Stack suggestion (fast build, low cost):
What	Tool
Frontend	Next.js + Tailwind CSS
Backend	Node.js / Fastify / Next.js API routes
Auth / DB	Supabase (users + saved templates)
Payments	Stripe
Hosting	Vercel (frontend) + Supabase (backend/db)

⚡ Extra sauce (future, not MVP):
AI prompt: “I want React + Tailwind + Supabase” → builds it

CI/CD config (GitHub Actions)

Deploy to Vercel directly

VSCode extension

📢 Marketing idea:
Tweet building in public:

“Tired of setting up Next.js projects? I’m building a SaaS that does it for you. Who wants early access?”

Share screenshots, GIFs, behind-the-scenes

IndieHackers + Reddit (r/webdev, r/SideProject)

First users = friends, Discord, Twitter devs

✏ Landing page copy draft:
⚡ Build. Ship. Repeat.
Stop wasting hours setting up your stack.
Pick your framework & tools → click → done.
Your custom, production-ready boilerplate in seconds.

CTA: “Generate my project now”
