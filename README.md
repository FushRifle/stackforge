📊 Competitor Analysis: StackForge
🧩 What is StackForge?
StackForge is a SaaS tool that helps developers scaffold full-stack applications fast, tailored to their stack:

One-click install of dependencies

Automated folder structure

Built-in options: ESLint, Prettier, Tailwind, state libs, testing libs

Push to GitHub or download zip instantly

🔍 Direct & Indirect Competitors
Name	What it offers	Strengths	Weaknesses
create-next-app	Official CLI to scaffold Next.js apps	Stable, official, free	Very basic; few customization options
Divjoy	Web UI to generate React apps (auth, billing, db)	Fast, visual UI, SaaS-focused	Paid, limited to React
StackBlitz	Instant dev environment for web apps	Live preview, great DX	Doesn’t scaffold production projects deeply
Vercel Templates	Deploy-ready Next.js templates	Official, easy deploy	Templates are static, limited stack choices
Plop.js / Hygen	Code generators	Highly customizable	CLI-only, manual setup, not SaaS
ShipFast / Shipixen	Premium Next.js SaaS templates	Beautiful design, SaaS-focused	Paid, fixed templates
Saas Pegasus	Django SaaS starter kit	Mature, includes auth & billing	Django-only, paid

🏆 How StackForge Stands Out
Feature	StackForge	Others
Visual dashboard + CLI	✅	❌ Mostly CLI-only
Custom stack builder (state libs, CSS, testing)	✅	❌ Mostly fixed templates
Live dependency install + GitHub push	✅	❌ Manual install
Multi-framework (Next.js, React, Vue, etc.)	Planned ✅	❌ Often single framework
Open to custom templates	✅	❌ Rare
Ongoing updates & security patches	✅	❌ Users must do manually

💡 Market Opportunity
~30M developers worldwide; most waste hours setting up projects.

Growing demand for:

Faster MVPs & prototypes

Side projects & SaaS startups

Low-config, opinionated tooling

Increasing complexity of modern stacks makes scaffolding valuable.

📈 Positioning
“StackForge is the Postman + Vercel + Turbo for project scaffolding:
a single place to design, generate, and launch your custom boilerplate instantly.”

✅ Next Steps
Launch MVP focused on Next.js + Tailwind + ESLint + Zustand

Add dashboard to track & manage generated projects

Integrate GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket

Build public template marketplace


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
